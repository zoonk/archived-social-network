  <strong>Bringing the best learning resources to everyone</strong>

## What is Zoonk?

Zoonk is a free, open-source website for sharing learning resources. We want to make easier for everyone to learn something new and understand how to use their knowledge in everyday life.

## Why is it important?

Our **educational system didn't change** much since the Industrial Revolution. We're just memorizing information to pass exams. That's why **[most people](https://www.nais.org/media/MemberDocuments/Research/2017-HSSSE-Final.pdf) find schools boring** and they don't understand how to apply school-based knowledge to everyday life.

We're already seeing the consequences: a **wave of fake news and science deniers** because people aren't interested in learning anymore. In the next decades, we'll face another challenge: most people won't be prepared for the **challenges presented by automation**.

We need to encourage people to acquire **lifelong learning skills** and make it easier for everyone to understand how complex topics (e.g. scientific concepts) are useful in their lives. Our goal is to **bring good learning experiences to the common folk** who wouldn't have an opportunity to get a high-quality education, **preparing them for an ever-changing society**.

In the long-term, **we should make learning as easy and fun as playing a video game** or posting a selfie on social media.
